PicSearch

---------

is made by Olivier, Victor, Fabrice and Jean-SÃ©bastien

is a bunch of clumsy webpages clumsily generated with LUA

is a good occasion to learn our way through HTML, CSS, LUA and even JavaScript for the bravest/most masochists of us 

---------

PicSearch uses the photos and metadatas hosted on http://prototypel1.irisa.fr sent by MyAppIstic users (meaning us) and should be able to do four things with it (one thing for each of us, how convenient) : 

It can show you a list of the photos and their titles in a gorgeous HTML table.<br>
It can display a Google Maps Itinerary to the GPS coordinates included in photos.<br>
It can display a Google Maps Street view of the places where the photos were taken.<br>
It can display a Google Maps map with every interesting places around the coordinates of a photo.<br>

---------

It should be ready by the end of January, fingers crossed.
